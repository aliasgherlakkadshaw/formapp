# Form App 

Interactive form builder, allows you to dynamically generate a form based on your selection.
This version uses ng-show and ng-hide to show and hide elements based on the user selection.
It uses localStorage to store the selection so that state is maintained even if the user
refreshes the page or closes the browser.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma.
